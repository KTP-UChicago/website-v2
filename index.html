          We are the University of Chicago chapter of Kappa Theta Pi, the
          country’s first professional technology fraternity. We seek to build
          an active community of students with a shared interest in technology.
          Additionally, we provide our members with a forum for expanding their
          technical skills, professional, and social development. We seek
          further to foster alumni relationships and network with corporations
          as well as serving our vibrant local community here in Hyde Park.

            Welcome to KTP! On behalf of our colony, I am excited to introduce
            you to our fraternity.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">
            Kappa Theta Pi is the nation’s first technology fraternity, open to
            anyone who is interested in tech. We are built on 5 main pillars:
            technical advancement, academic support, professional development,
            alumni connections, and social growth. From workshops, committees
            and projects, we offer many opportunities for members, regardless of
            technical ability, to learn and develop the skills necessary to
            succeed in today’s tech landscape. We are a culture that fosters
            intellectual curiosity, mentorship, and growth.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3">
            Not only do we pride ourselves with our growing network and
            professional opportunities, we are also a tight-knit group of
            technologists. With our big-little system and social events, members
            can bond with each other and make lifelong friendships. Even more
            exciting, as our fraternity grows, you have the chance to shape a
            dynamic culture and make an impact that transcends your 4 years
            here.
          </div>
          <div class="mb-3 mb-md-0">
            When our E-Board established this colony in the middle of the
            pandemic, it was certainly challenging but ultimately paid off. Our
            colony grew to 25 members of different majors, backgrounds, and
            interests. Outside of KTP, we are a community of RSO and student
            leaders, research assistants, TAs, and entrepreneurs.
            Professionally, we have members pursuing software engineering,
            product management, data science, finance, and entrepreneurship.
            There is no shortage of achievement here.

          <div class="mb-3">
            In KTP, we celebrate our diversity and come together with a common
            passion for technology. During rush, we do not discriminate against
            race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or background. We
            encourage everyone to bring their full authentic selves to the
            fraternity. Whether you come for the professional and technical
            opportunities or looking for a fun, inclusive community on campus,
            we hope that you see yourself thrive here.

            It is my pleasure to serve as KTP’s president, and I appreciate your
            interest in our fraternity. You can find more information about our
            rush process and brotherhood here on this website. Please don’t
            hesitate to reach out to any one of us on the E-Board with any
            questions you may have!
